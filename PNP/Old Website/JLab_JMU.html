<h3>Hall B: PMT Testing</h3>
<p>At JMU, our role involving JLab's Hall B is to receive, assemle bases, test, label, and package the
photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the CLAS-12 Hall B detector upgrade. We are assembling bases by
soldering and testing the PMTs for Dark Current and gain. Our test mechanism for DC testing is a black box
that we have constructed that allows no light into the PMTs, so that we can see the amount of current, literally
"in the dark" that is coming into the PMTs. This allows us to provide JLab with information for each specific
PMT so that they know what behavior to expect for any given PMT.</p>

<h3>Hall C: Time Of Flight (TOF) System</h3>
<p>The Time of Flight System (or TOF, for short) in the Hall C detector is the equipment that measures the
velocity of an incoming particle. The particle will fly through two scintillator sheets that detect it, and
measure its position and the time it takes to travel between the sheets. At JMU, our job is to glue PMTs to
the two ends of scintillator bars that we received so that the measurements can be taken. We are constructing
sliders with which we can accurately insert the PMTs into the scintillator holders, and then inserting them while
gluing them in place. The two sheets of scintillator/PMT will be placed roughly 1m apart in the same plane, but in
perpendicular directions. (x-y orthogonality) Once finished, the scintillator/PMT bars will be sent to JLAB in
storage boxes which we have also designed and built from scratch. The storage boxes will be made of wood with a
soft foam padding to protect the finished scintillator/PMT bars. All of these efforts will allow JLAB to install
the TOF system in 2013, with an expected experiment starting date of 2014.</p>
