<p>The JMU PNP Research Group is part of the James Madison University Department of Physics and Astronomy. Our focus is on high-energy
physics, concentrating in nuclear and particle experiments, searching for the building blocks of matter. The Physics Department is part
of the James Madison University College of Science and Mathematics. The Physics Department currently resides mainly on the second floor
of the Phys/Chem building, which is at the east side of the Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT) building. The nuclear labs are located
in rooms 2270 and 2272.</p>

<p>The Particle and Nuclear Research Group provides an explorative study of physics for Doctorate-level physics researchers,
and it also provides introductory level research exposure for undergratuate-level students interested in research. The JMU PNP
Research Group is part of multiple collaborative projects. Our focus is on development of particle detection technology. Our
group consists of three JMU facutly professors: Dr. Kevin Giovanetti, Dr. Gabriel Niculescu, and Dr. Ioana Niculescu. There are
also two graduate students and six undergraduate students involved in research for the 2010 summer, and possibly through the 2010-2011
school year.</p>

<p>Currently the PNP is involved in a lot of assembly and testing of parts for collaborative research projects. The Thomas Jefferson
National Laboratory in Newport News, VA, and Fermilab in Batavia, IL are the two main labs that we are working with. Our collaboration
involves people from all over the world including researchers from France, Switzerland, California, Illinois, etc. All of the contributors
are helping the projects to evolve into real physics experiments; currently, our main focus is to supply some of the hardware for these
projects.</p>
